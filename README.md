# Processing_Proyects
All the projects I have done while experimenting with [Processing](https://processing.org/). Beware this begins since High School so there might be things that don't suck and things that do suck. But I hope someone might find some things useful, recently I tried to catalog them in different folders depending on the topic the sketch is about.
